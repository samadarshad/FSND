# Live Heroku Project URL
https://vaccines-monitor-samad-fsnd.herokuapp.com/

# Motivation
Udacity Full-stack Capstone Project for Vaccine testing centres
- A doctor can manage patients (including creating/deleting new users), and administer vaccines
- A patient can only view and edit their own data
- A researcher can only view test results, and manage vaccines
- An admin can do everything

# Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Deployment to Localhost
`python app.py`
localhost:8080

# Deployment to Heroku
Push to master branch.
Heroku is setup to automatically pull in changes from master https://github.com/samadarshad/FSND and automatically deploy - so you dont need to run `(cd /media/sf_share/FSND && git subtree push --prefix projects/capstone/vaccines_monitor heroku master)`. You'd only need to run `run_migrations_on_heroku.sh` after any database migrations. You can also do `heroku run bash --app vaccines-monitor-samad-fsnd` for debugging.

# API Documentation & Testing

If you want to run the tests, click "Run in Postman" in the top right corner.
Note you will need to change the collection-variable `baseUrl` to be localhost:8080 if testing locally.
